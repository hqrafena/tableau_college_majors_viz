# tableau_college_majors_viz
This is an advanced visualization exercise which I worked on as the final project of a data visualization course for my master's program. 

## About the Dataset
I'd utilized the "College-majors" dataset folder from FiveThirtyEight's GitHub source. 
Five distinct.csv files with the names "majors-list," "recent-grads," "grad-students," "all-ages," and "women-stem" are included in the data folder.
The data files primarily give data on the number of women majoring in stem, the salary of recent graduates, the types of jobs that they do, and the unemployment rate. 
There is a common column in all these files that can be utilized to establish connections between them. 
I used the "Major-code" column in these files—apart from the "FOD1P" column in the "major-list" file, which is comparable to "Major-code"—to establish linkages between the "major-list" file and the other.csv files. 
This column's data type is Number(whole).
